## Acornsoft ViewSpell 1.1

This is a disassembly of the ViewSpell rom from Acornsoft, a Spell Checker
program.  It is being disassembled using beebdis. (TODO: Include link here).

Ultimate goal is to create an upto date version of the trilogy rom (Overview as a 64k rom image) using the latest version of the View family of Roms.
