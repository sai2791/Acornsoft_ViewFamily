## Acornsoft View B3.3 (Master MOS 3.50)

This is a disassembly of the View rom from Acornsoft, a word processing
program.  It is being disassembled using beebdis. (TODO: Include link here).

Ultimate goal is to create an upto date version of the trilogy rom (Overview as a 64k rom image) using the latest version of the View family of Roms.
