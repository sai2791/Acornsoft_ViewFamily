# Acornsoft View Family Rom Disassembly

This is a project to disassemble the Family of View products from Acornsoft
and eventually update the viewTrilogy rom image to the latest version of 
these programs

## Note
The beebdis included in this repository (all 4 copies, sorry) were compiled on 
Apple Silicon, but I did not specify only apple silicon so may still work
with Apple Intel.
