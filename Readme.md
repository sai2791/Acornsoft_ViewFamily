# Acornsoft View Family Rom Disassembly

This is a project to disassemble the Family of View products from Acornsoft
and eventually update the viewTrilogy rom image to the latest version of 
these programs

## Note
The beebdis included in this repository was built on an Intel Mac, I've not been able to build an aarm64 version
because of an error when linking,  macosx_min_version has been renamed to macos_min_version.  This is apparently 
a mac problem.
